                    <p>My name is Nurfahanis Binti Mohd Fazi. I am from Pekan, Pahang. I am 21 years old. I am the second child in two siblings. I was a student of STPM discharge at Dato’ Mahmud Mat school, Pekan, Pahang for 2 and a half years. After STPM graduation, I took a degree in course content management at the campus UiTM Puncak Perdana. I am an unyielding person, and I will also try to achieve what I want. My life motto is to make it work. Nothing is impossible if we dares to step forward.</p>

                                <li><span>Sekolah Rendah Pulau Serai (2009-2014)</span><br>When I was 7 years old, I went to SK Pulau Serai Pekan, Pahang for 6 years. I got 1A2B2C when I occupied UPSR. Primary school is an unforgettable experience. I had many friends when I was in elementary school. At primary school, I always participated in sports activities organised by the school. The sporting events I sat in were handball, netball, and volleyball.</li>
                                <li><span>Sekolah Menengah Peramu Jaya (2015-2019)</span><br>I went to school at SMK Peramu Jaya Pekan, Pahang. While attending school, I have been appointed to AJK or other positions at school. I hold the task of assisting and maintaining the activities performed by the club. When 2019, I sat for the SPM exam and I got the Results 3A2B3C+.</li>
                                <li><span>STPM Dato' Mahmud Mat (2020-2022)</span><br>I attended SMK Dato’ Mahmud Mat, and took STPM there. I went to school there for 2 and a half years as a result of Covid-19. Form 6 was a new experience for me as the lessons were quite different in high school and it was so much fun. While it's quite difficult to have to learn from home due to Covid but that doesn't break my passion for learning. I got CGPA STPM 2.58.</li>

                                <li><span>Malay</span><br>My language is Malay. I have grown up using this language in my everyday life. Wherever I go, I will use Malay.</li>
                                <li><span>English</span><br>My second language is English. English is also used by my family. This language is a language that must be taken in every school in Malaysia.</li>

                                <li><span>My Experience</span><br>When I attended school, I participated in many programs organized by the school in terms of picnics, sports and so on. I was also appointed to be the AJK and the secretary of the club. I have held several positions at a time. This experience had a positive impact on me as I was able to stand out to be a responsible and bolder person. I'm sure, if we try more, the more experience we can learn.
                                    I have had a lot of experience at a young age. This thing really helped me in the next time because getting older then the challenges we face are greater. This made me brave and not too afraid to try something new.</li>

        <p>Drawing is not just a mere activity for me; it is my passion, my escape, and my creative sanctuary. Engaging in the intricate dance between pencil and paper, I find solace in the strokes that bring my imagination to life. It is not just about creating visually appealing images; it's a profound expression of my thoughts, emotions, and perceptions. Whether I am sketching the delicate details of nature or letting my mind wander into the realms of fantasy, drawing allows me to communicate without words. It is my personal journey through lines and shades, a therapeutic process that rejuvenates my spirit and unveils the boundless possibilities of artistic exploration. In every stroke, I discover a piece of myself, and in every finished piece, I see a reflection of the endless inspiration that fuels my artistic soul. Here are some of my drawings</p>
